# Gemini model considerations

Overview

"Gemini" (Google) family of models is a powerful hosted LLM option. It offers strong conversational ability and can be used via hosted APIs (Gemini Pro / Gemini Ultra etc.).

Pros
- High-quality outputs for many conversational tasks.
- Hosted by Google: managed scaling and infrastructure.
- Good for tasks where fluency and creativity are needed.

Cons / considerations
- Cost: high-quality tiers are expensive for per-request usage.
- Privacy: requires sending user text to a hosted service unless a private deployment model is available.
- Availability & policy: ensure compliance with Google Cloud Terms and Play Store policies.

Integration approach

- Build a provider adapter in the backend that maps our SuggestRequest -> Gemini API calls and returns standardized SuggestResponse.
- Implement throttling, batching, and caching on server-side to control cost.

Personalization

- Options: RAG (store user embeddings and run retrieval before calling the model) or per-user fine-tuning (if supported by the provider). RAG is usually quicker to implement and more controllable.

Cost-control patterns

- Token budget per suggestion and per-user daily limits.
- Fall back to a cheaper model or on-device small model when budget is exceeded.

Safety

- Additional server-side moderation layer before returning suggestions to the client.
- Sanitize personally identifying data and warn users about cloud usage during opt-in.

## Documentation edit policy

Important: This provider documentation is covered by the repository's documentation edit policy. Do not edit or delete this file without explicit written approval from a project approver. You may append notes, journals, or link to new provider-specific implementation notes, but do not change historical content in-place. If a section must be changed, strike through the old content and append the replacement with a short rationale and date.

## Provider housekeeping suggestions

- When implementing a Gemini provider adapter, add a `providers/gemini/README.md` that documents:
	- Required credentials and permission scopes
	- Recommended rate limiting and cost-control patterns
	- Safety and moderation hooks to run prior to returning suggestions
- Include an integration test that can be run locally with mocked credentials.
