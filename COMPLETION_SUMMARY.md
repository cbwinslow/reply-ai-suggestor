## How It Works (End-to-End Flow)

1. **User Setup:**
   - Install app on Android device
   - Accept privacy consent dialog
   - Enable keyboard in Android Settings
   - Open SMS app

2. **Using the Keyboard:**
   - Switch to ReplyAISuggester keyboard
   - Start typing a message
   - Tap "Suggest" button
   - View 3 AI-generated suggestions
   - Tap a suggestion to insert it
   - Continue typing or send message

3. **Backend Processing:**
   - Keyboard sends context to backend
   - Backend generates suggestions based on:
     - User's typed text (context)
     - Selected modes (casual, formal, witty)
     - Intensity setting (0-10)
   - Suggestions returned with tone labels
   - Keyboard displays them in suggestion strip

4. **Privacy Controls:**
   - Access Settings from main app
   - Toggle consent and personalization
   - Adjust intensity slider
   - Export/upload/delete personal data
   - All data encrypted at rest
