# Project Journal (append-only)

Use this space for short, dated project notes, decisions, and meeting outcomes. Append-only: do not remove prior entries. To mark an entry as superseded, strike through the line and add a supersession note below it.

Example:
- 2025-10-31 | @alice | Decided to use InputMethodService for MVP. Rationale: Play Store risk reduction.
