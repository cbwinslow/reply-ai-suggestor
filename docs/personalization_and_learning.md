# Personalization and Learning Pipeline Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for the personalization and learning pipeline in the Reply AI Suggester. The primary goal is to enable users to customize the AI's suggestions to their personal writing style while upholding strict privacy principles. This is achieved through a combination of local data processing, explicit user consent, and privacy-preserving techniques.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Privacy by Design:** User privacy is the default. No personal data is collected or processed without explicit, informed consent.
*   **User Control:** Users have complete control over their data, including the ability to view, export, and delete it at any time.
*   **Transparency:** The system is transparent about what data is being collected and how it is being used.

## 3. Data Collection

Data for personalization is collected from several points, always with user consent:

*   **Typing Patterns:**
    *   **Data:** Frequency of words, phrases, and emoji. Sentence structure and length.
    *   **Collection:** Locally on the device.
*   **Suggestion Acceptance Rates:**
    *   **Data:** Which suggestions are accepted, ignored, or modified by the user.
    *   **Collection:** Locally on the device.
*   **Context Analysis:**
    *   **Data:** The context of the conversation (e.g., work, social). This is a high-level categorization, not the raw text.
    *   **Collection:** Locally on the device.

## 4. User Consent and Data Control

A granular consent model is used to give users control over their data.

*   **Initial Onboarding:**
    *   A clear and concise onboarding screen explains the benefits of personalization and the data that will be used.
    *   Users must explicitly opt-in to enable personalization.
*   **Settings Screen:**
    *   A dedicated section in the settings screen allows users to:
        *   Enable or disable personalization at any time.
        *   View the data that has been collected.
        *   Export their personalization data.
        *   Delete all of their personalization data from the device and the server (if applicable).
*   **Just-in-Time Consent:**
    *   For more sensitive data or new types of data collection, the app will ask for consent at the moment it is needed.

## 5. Privacy-Preserving Data Processing

To protect user privacy, the following techniques are used:

*   **Local Processing:**
    *   As much data processing as possible is done on the user's device.
    *   This minimizes the amount of data that needs to be sent to a server.
*   **Local Aggregation:**
    *   Data is aggregated locally to create a profile of the user's writing style.
    *   This profile is a statistical model, not a collection of raw text.
*   **Differential Privacy:**
    *   When data is sent to a server for more advanced model training (an optional, opt-in feature), differential privacy techniques are applied.
    *   This adds noise to the data to ensure that individual users cannot be identified.

## 6. Personalization Pipeline

The personalization pipeline consists of the following stages:

1.  **Local Learning:**
    *   The app continuously learns from the user's interactions on the device.
    *   This local model provides immediate personalization without needing to send data to a server.
2.  **Secure Server-Side Fine-Tuning (Optional):**
    *   For users who opt-in, their aggregated and differentially private data is sent to a secure server.
    *   This data is used to fine-tune a personal language model for the user.
    *   This fine-tuned model can then be used to provide higher-quality suggestions.
3.  **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    *   As an alternative to fine-tuning, a RAG approach can be used.
    *   This involves creating a vector database of the user's writing style on the device.
    *   When generating suggestions, the model retrieves relevant examples from this database to inform the generation process.
